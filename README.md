# Spring Security LTI 1.3 Implementation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/oxctl/spring-security-lti13.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/oxctl/spring-security-lti13)

This library adds support to Spring Security to allow LTI 1.3 launches to authenticate a user. This is still a work in progress and will be changing substantially in the near future.

## Spring Security OAuth2

This library uses [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) and it's OAuth code as it's basis.
